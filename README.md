# CF Postal Worker

This is a Cloudflare Workers project that leverages Cloudflare Email Routing, allowing you to send information to your email via API calls.

Use Cases:
- If you have a static web project and don't want to develop a backend or maintain a database, you can integrate a contact form to directly send information to your email.
- Other scenarios where you need to forward messages to an email.
